# simple_os_kernel_simulation
This project implements a simple operating system kernel simulation using C++. It is designed to demonstrate fundamental concepts in operating system design, including process management, scheduling, and interrupt handling. The kernel manages process creation, execution, and termination, and simulates timer and I/O interrupts.
